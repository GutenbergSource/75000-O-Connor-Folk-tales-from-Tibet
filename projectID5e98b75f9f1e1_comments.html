<HTML><BODY>A collection of Tibetan folk tales which a British interpreter collected at the beginning of the 20th century in Lhasa and Gyantse in Tibet. Unlike many stories presented elsewhere as Tibetan, they are not directly derived from Indian sources (such as for example the Kanjur; those I will present in another project). This book is illustrated with 12 lovely color illustrations by an unnamed (unfortunately) Tibetan artist.

<p>No difficulties expected, so have fun.
